Todos (if given more time)

- Write a lot more unit tests - e.g for getting same colour neighbours, moving block down columns etc
- Add a score component to be displayed on screen with exponentially increasing points for each additional block destroyed. 
- Animate the destruction of blocks and possibly add sound effects. 
- Create a Main Menu and Game Over screen.
